# Huffman Encoding Implementation
 
This project implements Huffman encoding using a Huffman tree.
It can encode and decode files. It compresses the most with txt files,
and only compresses moderately with image file types (e.g. jpg, png).
All files types will decode to be the same as the original file.

Encode method outputs a frequency file and encoded file using file to encode.
Decode method outputs a decoded file using a frequency file and encoded file.

The dependencies of HuffmanSubmit.java are BinaryIn.java, BinaryOut.java, and Huffman.java.
The files to encode/decode and frequency files all need to be in the same local folder.
